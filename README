====================================
 Twitter Authentication Module 1.1
         For SilverStripe
====================================
Developed and maintained by RentBox
 support@rentbox.co.nz/@rentboxapp
====================================

Requirements:
* Twitter consumer key/secret
	- https://dev.twitter.com/apps

Installation:
- Extract twitter folder to your site root
- Provide your consumer key/secret using the provided methods
	(TwitterCallback::set_consumer_key/secret)
- Run /dev/build

This adds two extra fields to the Member table, TwitterID and TwitterHandle.
OAuth tokens *are not* stored. You can not use this module for communicating
with Twitter beyond the sign in process.

This module adds a button to MemberFormFields, but not FrontendField. You can
add your own button as well. For an example of how to do so, have a look at
TwitterIdentifier, twitter.js and the three related methods in TwitterCallback.
